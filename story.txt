Once upon a time there was a rat that loved to cook. However, his family didn't approve. They said rats weren't meant to cook. One day, a flood caused an overflow of 
water in the sewers where the rat lived. The rat was seperated from his family and all other rats and didn't know what to do. When the rat realized he was in Paris, he 
decided to local for the most popular restaurant. There he found an underwhelming cook.
